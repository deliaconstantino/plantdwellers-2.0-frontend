# PlantDwellers

PlantDwellers app allows roommates to track their houseplants in a central respository and care for their plants communally via a shared calendar. 

A user can search for plants via the [OpenFarm api](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm) to add to their home. Authorization is provided by JSON Web Tokens. A user may add and delete own plants, but may update care stats for any plants in their home via shared calendar.
