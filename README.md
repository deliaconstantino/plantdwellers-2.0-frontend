# PlantDwellers 2.0

A React Single Page Application that allows housemates to share in the care of their houseplants. This app incorporates a calendar from [React-Calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar) that schedules watering tasks and allows a user to mark the task complete.

This repo is the front end for PlantDwellers 2.0. It uses Redux, React Router, and Tailwind CSS.

The back end of the app can be found at [plantdwellers-2.0-backend](https://github.com/deliaconstantino/plantdwellers-2.0-backend) with instructions for database creation, seed data, and running the Rails server. Note that the back end will need to be running through Rails server while viewing the front end.

# Configuration

To get started with PlantDwellers 2.0, fork and clone this front end repo.

Ensure that your back end is fully set up and running Rails server.

Run `npm run start` from the root of your front end and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. This will load the front end, complete with styling from Tailwind, in the browser, powered by your local environment.

Happy planting!
